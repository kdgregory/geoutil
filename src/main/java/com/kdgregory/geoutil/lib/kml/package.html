    An (incomplete) implementation of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference">KML 2.2 specification</a>.
    <p>
    To use, create a {@link KmlFile} instance and add features to it; when done, write it to an output file:
    <pre>
    KmlFile file = new KmlFile()
                   .addFeature(new Folder()
                               .setDescription("example file")
                               .addFeature(new Placemark()
                                           .setDescription("City Hall")
                                           .setGeometry(new KmlPoint(39.9521, -75.1626))));
    file.write(new File("myfirstproject.kml"));
    </pre>
    <p>
    You can also read existing files and search for the features they contain:
    <pre>
    KmlFile file = KmlFile.parse(new File("garmin_track.kml"));
    for (Folder folder : kmlfile.find(Folder.class, "Track Points"))
    {
        for (Placemark pm : folder.find(Placemark.class, null))
        {
            // do something with the placemarks
        }
    }
    </pre>
</body>
